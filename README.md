# Liri Node App

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
## Getting Started

Since this assignment is done exclusively in the terminal using node, there is no deployable site.  Below you will find links to the gifs showing the functionality of the APP.
